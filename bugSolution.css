The solution is to ensure the URL used in the `content` property is valid and accessible.  If you need to handle potential errors gracefully, you can use a fallback mechanism. For instance, you could set a default value if the URL is invalid:

```css
.element::before {
  content: url('valid-image.jpg');
  content: url('valid-image.jpg') no-repeat;
}
```
This ensures that something displays even if the primary URL fails to load.  You can also use JavaScript to dynamically set the `content` property based on whether the image loads successfully.
