# Uncommon CSS Bug: `content` Property with Invalid URL

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the CSS `content` property when used with an invalid URL within the `::before` or `::after` pseudo-elements.  The issue is that an incorrect or inaccessible URL can lead to unexpected behavior without clear error messages in the browser's developer console, making it challenging to debug.

## Bug Description

Setting the `content` property to a URL that doesn't exist or is inaccessible can result in the generated content not appearing.  There might be no visual indication of the problem, making it difficult to track down the source of the error.

## Reproduction

1. Open `bug.css` and examine the code for the problematic URL.
2. Open `bug.html` (if provided) or create a simple HTML file that includes the CSS and an element that utilizes the `::before` or `::after` pseudo-elements.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior in your browser.

## Solution

The solution lies in ensuring that the URLs specified within the `content` property are valid and accessible.  Proper error handling and validation during development can prevent this issue.
